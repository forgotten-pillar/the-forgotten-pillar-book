God has given Sister White presentations regarding the deceptions that Satan is bringing into our church. She was instructed that we should read to and understand the works of our pioneers in order to combat these deceptions.


Mungu amempa Dada White mawasilisho kuhusu udanganyifu ambao Shetani analeta ndani ya kanisa letu. Aliagizwa kwamba tunapaswa kusoma na kuelewa maneno ya mapainia ili kupambana na udanganyifu huu.


\egw{\textbf{I have had presentations regarding the deceptions that Satan is \underline{bringing in at this time}}. \textbf{I have been instructed} that \textbf{we should make prominent the testimony of some of the \underline{old workers} who are now dead}. \textbf{Let them continue to speak through their articles as found \underline{in the early numbers of our papers}}. \textbf{These articles should now be reprinted, that there may be \underline{a living voice from the Lord’s witnesses}}. \textbf{\underline{The history of the early experiences in the message will be a power to withstand the masterly ingenuity of Satan’s deceptions}.} This instruction has been repeated recently. I must present before the people \textbf{the testimonies of Bible truth and repeat the decided messages given years ago}...}[Lt99-1905.7; 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p9997.13]


\egw{\textbf{Nimekuwa na mawasilisho kuhusu udanganyifu ambao Shetani analeta \underline{ndani katika wakati huu}}. \textbf{Nimeagizwa} kwamba \textbf{tunapaswa kuweka kipaumbele ushuhuda wa baadhi ya \underline{wafanyakazi wa zamani} ambao sasa wamekufa}. \textbf{Waache waendelee kuongea kupitia kwa makala yao kama inavyopatikana \underline{katika nambari za mapema za majarida yetu}}. \textbf{Nakala hizi sasa zinapaswa kuchapishwa tena, ili kuwe na \underline{sauti iliyo hai kutoka kwa mashahidi wa Bwana}}. \textbf{\underline{Historia ya uzoefu wa mapema katika ujumbe utakuwa nguvu ya kuhimili ujanja mkuu wa Udanganyifu wa Shetani}.} Agizo hili limerudiwa hivi karibuni. Lazima niwasilishe mbele ya watu \textbf{ushuhuda wa ukweli wa Biblia na kurudia jumbe zilizoamuliwa zilizotolewa kwa miaka iliyopita}...}[Lt99-1905.7; 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p9997.13]


\egw{\textbf{When men come in who would move one pin or pillar from the foundation} \textbf{which God has established by His Holy Spirit}, \textbf{let the} \textbf{\underline{aged men who were pioneers} in our work \underline{speak plainly}, and let those who are dead \underline{speak also by reprinting of their articles in our periodicals}}. Gather up the rays of divine light that God has given \textbf{as He has led His people on step by step in the way of truth}. \textbf{This truth will stand the test of time and trial}.}[Ms62-1905.20, 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p10026.26]


\egw{\textbf{Wanadamu wanapoingia ndani ambao wangehamisha nguzo moja au nguzo kutoka kwenye msingi} \textbf{ambao Mungu ameanzisha kupitia kwa Roho wake Mtakatifu}, \textbf{waache} \textbf{\underline{wazee waliokuwa waanzilishi} katika kazi yetu \underline{waongee waziwazi}, na wacha wale waliokufa \underline{waongee pia kwa kuchapishwa kwa makala yao tena ndani ya magazeti yetu}}. Kusanya miale ya mionzi ya kimungu ambayo Mungu ametupea \textbf{kama alivyowaongoza watu wake hatua kwa hatua katika njia ya ukweli}. \textbf{Ukweli huu utastahimili mtihani wa wakati na kesi}.}[Ms62-1905.20, 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p10026.26]


We have seen that the Seventh-day Adventist Church has experienced the change in our foundation regarding the \emcap{personality of God}. We have been told that the first truth received by our pioneers will stand the test of time and trial. Has the truth on the \emcap{personality of God}, which we’ve received first, failed the test of time?


Tumeona kwamba Kanisa la Waadventista Wasabato limepata mabadiliko katika misingi yetu kuhusu \emcap{Umbile la Mungu}. Tumeambiwa kwamba ukweli wa kwanza uliopokelewa na waanzilishi wetu utastahimili mtihani wa wakati na kesi. Je, ukweli juu ya \emcap{Umbile la Mungu}, ambao tumepokea kwanza, umeanguka mtihani wa wakati?


\egw{\textbf{When the power of God testifies to what is truth, the truth is to stand forever as the truth}. \textbf{No after suppositions, contrary to the light God has given are to be entertained}. Men will arise with interpretations of Scripture which are to them truth, but which are not truth. \textbf{The truth for this time, God has given us as \underline{a foundation for our faith}.} \textbf{He Himself has taught us what is truth.} One will arise and still another with new light which \textbf{contradicts }the light that God has given under the demonstration of His Holy Spirit. \textbf{A few are still alive who passed through the experience gained in the establishment of this truth}. God has graciously spared their lives\textbf{ to repeat and repeat} till the close of their lives, \textbf{the experience through which they passed} even as did John the apostle till the very close of his life. \textbf{And the standard bearers who have fallen in death, are to \underline{speak through the reprinting of their writings}. \underline{I am instructed} that thus [their] voices are to be heard}. \textbf{\underline{They are to bear their testimony as to what constitutes the truth for this time.}} \textbf{We are not to receive the words of those who come with a message \underline{that contradicts the special points of our faith}}. They gather together a mass of Scripture, and pile it as proof around their asserted theories. This has been done over and over again during the past fifty years. And while the Scriptures are God’s Word, and are to be respected, the application of them,\textbf{ if such application moves one pillar of the foundation that God has sustained these fifty years, is a great mistake}. He who makes such an application knows not the wonderful demonstration of the Holy Spirit that gave power and force to the past messages that have come to the people of God.}[PH020 14.2; 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p276.89]


\egw{\textbf{Nguvu ya Mungu inaposhuhudia kile ambacho ni kweli, ukweli unafaa kusimama milele kama ukweli}. \textbf{Hapana dhana ya kuchipuka baadaye, kinyume na mwanga ambao Mungu amepeana inapaswa kupewa nafasi au ruhusa}. Watu watainuka wakiwa na tafsiri za Maandiko ambazo kwao ni kweli, lakini si ukweli. \textbf{Ukweli wa wakati huu, Mungu ametupa kama \underline{msingi wa imani yetu}.} \textbf{Yeye Mwenyewe ametufundisha ambacho ni ukweli.} Mmoja atatokea na mwingine pia na mwanga mpya ambao \textbf{unakinzana }na nuru ambayo Mungu amepeana chini ya onyesho la Roho wake Mtakatifu. \textbf{Wachache bado wako hai ambao walipitia uzoefu uliopatikana katika kuanzishwa kwa ukweli huu}. Mungu kwa neema ameyaokoa maisha yao\textbf{ kurudia na kurudia} hadi mwisho wa maisha yao, \textbf{uzoefu ambao walioipitia} hata kama alivyopitia Yohana mtume hadi mwisho kabisa wa maisha yake. \textbf{Na washikaji viwango walioanguka katika mauti, wanafaa \underline{kunena kupitia kwa njia ya uchapishaji upya wa maandishi yao}. \underline{Nimeagizwa} kwamba sauti [zao] zisikike}. \textbf{\underline{Wanapaswa kutoa ushuhuda wao kuhusu kile kinachojumuisha ukweli wa wakati huu.}} \textbf{Hatufai kupokea maneno ya wale wanaokuja na ujumbe \underline{unaopingana na pointi maalum za imani yetu}}. Wanakusanya Maandiko mengi, na kuyarundika kama uthibitisho kuzunguka nadharia zao zinazodai. Hii imefanywa tena na tena katika kipindi cha miaka hamsini iliyopita. Na maadamu Maandiko ni Neno la Mungu, na yanapaswa kuheshimiwa, matumizi ya yao,\textbf{ ikiwa matumizi hayo yatasongesha nguzo moja ya msingi ambao Mungu ameendeleza miaka hii hamsini, ni kosa kubwa}. Yeye ambaye hufanya matumizi kama hayo hajui onyesho la ajabu la Roho Mtakatifu aliyeipea nguvu jumbe zilizopita ambazo zimewafikia watu wa Mungu.}[PH020 14.2; 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p276.89]


Let us become acquainted with the writing of our pioneers regarding the first point of the \emcap{Fundamental Principles}. Let’s become acquainted with the truth the pioneers wrote about the \emcap{personality of God} and where His presence is. Let us, \egwinline{gather up the rays of divine light that God has given as He has led His people on step by step in the way of truth.}[Ms62-1905.20, 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p10026.26]


Hebu tufahamiane na uandishi wa waanzilishi wetu kuhusu hoja ya kwanza ya \emcap{Kanuni za Msingi}. Hebu tufahamiane na ukweli ambao mapainia waliandika kuhusu \emcap{Umbile la Mungu} na mahali uwepo wake ulipo. Hebu, \egwinline{tukusanye miale ya nuru ya kimungu ambayo Mungu amewapea kama alivyowaongoza watu wake hatua kwa hatua katika njia ya ukweli.}[Ms62-1905.20, 1905][https://egwwritings.org/read?panels=p10026.26]
