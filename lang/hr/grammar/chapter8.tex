I've examined the Croatian text and found no grammar mistakes. The text appears to be grammatically correct throughout. The LaTeX formatting is properly maintained, and the sentence structures follow Croatian grammar rules.

The text discusses theological concepts related to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, particularly focusing on the understanding of God's personality and presence as described in their Fundamental Principles, and contrasting this with Dr. Kellogg's views expressed in his book “The Living Temple.”

No corrections are needed for this text.
