Looking at the Croatian text, I don't see any significant grammar errors that need correction. The text appears to be grammatically correct Croatian with proper LaTeX formatting. The text discusses theological concepts related to Adventist beliefs and contains many quotations from Ellen G. White (marked with \egw{} tags).

The text uses proper Croatian case endings, verb conjugations, and sentence structures. The LaTeX formatting with \chapter{}, \emcap{}, \textbf{}, \underline{}, \textit{}, etc. is consistently applied throughout the document.

Since I don't find any grammar errors to correct, there are no specific items to list in the requested format.
