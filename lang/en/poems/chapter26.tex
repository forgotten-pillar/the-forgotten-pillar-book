% Steps to Omega

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        On pillars now, the shadows cast— \\
        A truth forsaken, from the past. \\
        In steps they chart the silent drift, \\
        Five marks of change, through sacred rift.
    }

    \stanza{
        Denial blooms when once truth stood, \\
        Foundations are not understood, \\
        The fundamentals, once held dear \\
        Obscured, as new creeds appear.
    }

    \stanza{
        Prophetic warnings have been dimmed, \\
        Pioneers are shunned, old hymns are trimmed. \\
        The testimonies once rang out \\
        But now they’re often tinged with doubt.
    }

    \stanza{
        “God is a person” cast aside, \\
        And now His essence they deride. \\
        Forgotten pillar once was strong \\
        Now a new pillar, which is wrong!
    }

    \stanza{
        Scholars now twist the sacred term, \\
        Words redefined, they now affirm. \\
        Gone is the quest to see God’s face, \\
        Dim the desire for His embrace.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Kellogg crisis point is missed, \\
        The alpha given untrue twist \\
        And thus, the lessons are not learned \\
        The church toward omega turned.
    }

    \stanza{
        Confusion reigns, we can’t perceive \\
        It is not clear what we believe \\
        Our history has been revised \\
        We wanted truth, but then they lied.
    }
