    \stanza{
        By visions Ellen White stood firm, \\
        Against false views; she did affirm. \\
        The Father’s form, a truth profound, \\
        In this essential faith was found.
    }

    \stanza{
        "Spiritualizers" sought to claim \\
        That heaven’s realm was but a name. \\
        Yet God has form, like Christ His Son, \\
        This truth our founders built upon.
    }

    \stanza{
        A Spirit Person God does reign \\
        The universe is His domain \\
        This doctrine once our cornerstone, \\
        Has somehow from our statements flown.
    }
