% The Historical Context

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        In visions clear, Ellen White stood firm, \\
        Against false views she did affirm. \\
        The Father's form, a truth profound, \\
        In this essential faith was found.
    }

    \stanza{
        The "spiritualizers" sought to claim \\
        That heaven's realm was but a name. \\
        Yet God has form, like Christ His Son, \\
        This truth our founders built upon.
    }

    \stanza{
        A personal God on throne divine, \\
        Not merely spirit, by design. \\
        This doctrine once our cornerstone, \\
        Has from our statements somehow flown.
    }
