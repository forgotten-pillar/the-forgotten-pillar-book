% Adventist pioneers and the Trinity doctrine

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The pioneers stood most earnestly \\
        Against belief in trinity. \\
        They saw this doctrine did disguise, \\
        What Scripture shows discerning eyes.
    }

    \stanza{
        James White declared this fable led \\
        To errors that were then widespread \\
        For three co-equal beings merged \\
        Into one God, must not be urged.
    }

    \stanza{
        Two separate persons were aligned, \\
        In spirit, action, goal and mind. \\
        For just as men in Christ are one, \\
        So are the Father and the Son.
    }

    \stanza{
        Distinct They are, divinity, \\
        It’s not the same as trinity \\
        God’s Spirit sent from up above, \\
        The active agent of God’s love.
    }

    \stanza{
        Nicaea’s creed had been prepared. \\
        No Scripture says what men declared, \\
        Inspired truth they had not heard. \\
        They’d never read it in God’s Word.
    }

    \stanza{
        John seventeen great truths reveal, \\
        Before the one true God we kneel \\
        Eternal life comes through His Son \\
        Our Savior, the Begotten One.
    }

    \stanza{
        Christ is divine, the Son of God \\
        We worship Him, with honor laud. \\
        The express image of God’s face, \\
        Inherits fullness of His grace.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pioneers knew, God’s word is clear, \\
        The great Almighty God so dear. \\
        As personal, He reigns on high, \\
        His Spirit in us, ever nigh.
    }

    \stanza{
        The truth stands fast in error’s night, \\
        Preserved by God through Sister White. \\
        The pioneers shunned the mystery thought, \\
        For through the scriptures, they were taught.
    }
