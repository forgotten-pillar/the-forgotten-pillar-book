% The Final Call

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Stand firm on truth, reject false light, \\
        Hold fast to principles so bright. \\
        Wake up, God’s servants, sound alarm, \\
        Guard sacred truths from Satan’s harm.
    }

    \stanza{
        Father and Son, distinct and true, \\
        Their personalities are two. \\
        Avoid what will mislead the heart, \\
        God’s truths divine set us apart.
    }

    \stanza{
        We must keep truth that we first heard, \\
        Faithful to teachings of His Word, \\
        Joined with our Maker in His love, \\
        Blessed with the Spirit from above.
    }

    \stanza{
        Time’s growing short—this final call, \\
        Choose now the light so you won’t fall. \\
        Soon in the sky, Christ will appear \\
        Father will greet us, ever near.
    }
