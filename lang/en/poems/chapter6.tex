    \stanza{
        Sister White's vision stands against the tide, \\
        As Trinity's doctrine she firmly denied. \\
        Her words a warning, clear and bright, \\
        Against teachings that dimmed revealed light.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pillars of faith, established with care, \\
        Now face a challenge, a doctrine to beware. \\
        For what was built through prayer and revelation, \\
        Faces change through doctrinal innovation.
    }

    \stanza{
        The personality of God, once clearly known, \\
        Now wrapped in theories not heaven's own. \\
        Past experiences of God's people at stake, \\
        When foundations new doctrines would break.
    }

    \stanza{
        The waymarks that made us what we are, \\
        Should guide us still, like a guiding star. \\
        Hold firmly to principles with faith's strong grip, \\
        Lest in confusion's fog we lose our ship.
    }
