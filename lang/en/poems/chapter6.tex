% Examining Test

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The visions stand against the tide \\
        And all false doctrines are denied \\
        The testimony, clear and bright \\
        Expose the false, and bring forth light.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pillars which were set with care \\
        Now face a challenge, so beware \\
        The platform built by God’s wise plan \\
        Is weakened now by wayward man.
    }

    \stanza{
        God is a person, God’s church knew \\
        But since forgot, by words untrue \\
        Our past experience was robbed \\
        Untempered mortar has been daubed.
    }

    \stanza{
        The waymarks made us what we are, \\
        Should guide us still, our guiding star. \\
        Hold principles with faith’s strong grip, \\
        Lest in the fog we lose our ship.
    }
