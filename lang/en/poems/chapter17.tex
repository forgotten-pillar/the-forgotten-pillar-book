\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The light of truth, so clear and bold, \\
        A crisis came, a story told. \\
        Not pantheism, dim and wide, \\
        But God’s persona, we confide.
    }

    \stanza{
        But God, through Ellen, did uphold \\
        God’s personality was told. \\
        Against the Trinity, she leaned, \\
        A unity, by John unseen.
    }

    \stanza{
        "The Father and the Son," she wrote, \\
        Are one in purpose was her quote. \\
        John seventeen, her chosen guide, \\
        Where God’s true nature cannot hide.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pioneers, with her agreed, \\
        Of God’s true person, they did plead. \\
        Loughborough echoed, his words clear, \\
        The Trinity dismissed, no fear.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Fundamental Points, so dear, \\
        They make it plain, we must revere. \\
        Not in the trinity’s wrong creed, \\
        But in His presence, faith is freed.
    }

    \stanza{
        So let us stand on truth so bright, \\
        Rejecting wrong, with all our might. \\
        God’s person, where we find our plea, \\
        Truth’s platform for eternity.
    }
