% The proper solution

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Now heed the words of those long past, \\
        Their sacred truths were built to last. \\
        Return to pillars set with care, \\
        For God revealed His nature there.
    }

    \stanza{
        Deceptive errors have crept in, \\
        To move the pillars is a sin. \\
        The pio'neers’ voices still should speak, \\
        Their ancient wisdom we should seek.
    }

    \stanza{
        For Ellen counseled in her day, \\
        From early light we must not stray. \\
        God’s personality divine, \\
        This truth the pioneer words define.
    }
