% Heaven's reality

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        God is not a vapor unknown, \\
        Not as a mystery on His throne. \\
        In just one place as beings are, \\
        Yet by His Spirit spread afar.
    }

    \stanza{
        Christ bears God’s image as His Son, \\
        Two beings divine, not joined as one. \\
        Angels have bodies, yet unseen, \\
        Physical forms with heav’nly sheen.
    }

    \stanza{
        We cannot see their spirit frame, \\
        Until immortal life we claim. \\
        We’ll resurrect like them to be, \\
        And dwell with them eternally.
    }

    \stanza{
        God is not three in mystic blend, \\
        But Father, Son, Their Spirit send. \\
        The Father, Son are not obscure, \\
        They’re personal, we know for sure.
    }
