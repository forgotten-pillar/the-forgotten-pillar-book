% Heaven's reality

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        God is not vapor, nor mystery unknown, \\
        A personal being upon Heaven's throne. \\
        Bound by space as a being must, \\
        Yet present through His Spirit's trust.
    }

    \stanza{
        Christ bears His image, a tangible Son, \\
        Two divine beings, not mystically one. \\
        Angels around them with bodies unseen, \\
        Material creatures of heavenly sheen.
    }

    \stanza{
        Our eyes cannot witness their spiritual frame, \\
        Until God reveals what our vision can't claim. \\
        In resurrection we'll rise like them too, \\
        Spiritual bodies, yet tangible and true.
    }

    \stanza{
        Not three equal persons in mystical blend, \\
        But Father and Son with Spirit they send. \\
        The divine is not distant, abstract, or obscure, \\
        But personal, present, and perfectly sure.
    }
