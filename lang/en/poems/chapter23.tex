% The great apostasy is soon to be realized

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        A letter penned—crisis foretold, \\
        From Ellen White, a warning bold: \\
        "Adhere to the roots” it did declare. \\
        Of this apostasy, beware!
    }

    \stanza{
        The pillars of our founding year, \\
        Are under siege, she wrote with fear. \\
        Must "Meet it!" now was her command, \\
        To hold the line, to firmly stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        "Keep to the principles," – a plea \\
        From the prophetic time decree. \\
        For truth confirmed by Spirit’s flame, \\
        Won’t be denied, nor put to shame.
    }

    \stanza{
        Workings of Satan causes sway, \\
        To change our course, to lead astray. \\
        But steadfast hearts must ever cling \\
        To early truths that God did bring.
    }

    \stanza{
        Hold fast, she wrote, to what we know, \\
        The Founding Principles that show \\
        The way to live, the path to trod, \\
        Under the gaze of our Holy God.
    }

    \stanza{
        For as the world spins to its close, \\
        The truth of Ellen White still glows— \\
        A beacon strong against the night, \\
        Guiding the faithful in the right.
    }
