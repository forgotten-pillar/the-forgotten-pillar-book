% The great apostasy is soon to be realized

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        In a letter penned, a crisis foretold, \\
        From Ellen White, a warning bold: \\
        "Adhere to the roots of our Adventist comprehend, \\
        For soon will come apostasy's seed."
    }

    \stanza{
        The pillars strong of our founding year, \\
        Are under siege, as Ellen feared. \\
        To "Meet it!" was her stern command, \\
        To hold the line, to firmly stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        "Keep to the principles," her urgent plea, \\
        From 1844's prophetic decree. \\
        For truth confirmed by the Spirit's flame, \\
        Shall not be denied, nor put to shame.
    }

    \stanza{
        The enemy seeks to divide and sway, \\
        To change our course, to lead astray. \\
        But steadfast hearts must ever cling \\
        To the first truths that made our spirits sing.
    }

    \stanza{
        Hold fast, she wrote, to what we know, \\
        The Fundamental Principles that show \\
        The way to live, the path to trod, \\
        Under the gaze of an unchanging God.
    }

    \stanza{
        For as the world spins toward its close, \\
        The truth of Ellen White still glowsâ€” \\
        A beacon strong against the night, \\
        Guiding the faithful in the right.
    }
