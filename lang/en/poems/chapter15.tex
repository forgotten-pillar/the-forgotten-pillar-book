% Dr. Kellogg and the Trinity doctrine

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In Kellogg’s quest, the question posed, \\
        "The Spirit – how is He composed?" \\
        The issue stirred a great debate, \\
        How does this mystery relate?
    }

    \stanza{
        The question was beyond the seen \\
        To trinity J.H. did lean \\
        The Father wasn’t bound by space? \\
        Without a body or a face?
    }

    \stanza{
        To Ellen, Jesus did inform \\
        Like Him, His Father had a form \\
        “I am His image as express, \\
        Revealing form and righteousness.”
    }

    \stanza{
        In vision was the truth revealed \\
        The inspiration, it was sealed \\
        The Father’s form upon the throne \\
        And Christ with form just like His own.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Spirit’s personality \\
        In actions and in quality \\
        A role distinct, within us dwells. \\
        The mind of Christ the Spirit tells.
    }

    \stanza{
        God’s power and His presence show \\
        Wherever God would have it go \\
        And thus, He’s present everywhere \\
        Invisible, His Spirit there.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Living Temple showed a flaw \\
        A dangerous error Ellen saw \\
        The wayward theories in his mind \\
        Blocked him from truth he could not find.
    }

    \stanza{
        He went off searching on his own \\
        And did not follow what was shown \\
        If he had stayed where God had led, \\
        His teaching would have never spread.
    }
