% The prophetic call for a renewal of the old pillars

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        God calls us to renew the faith of old, \\
        The pillars of our truth, precious as gold. \\
        Fundamental principles we must reclaim, \\
        Standing firm in His eternal name.
    }

    \stanza{
        The straight testimony must be borne, \\
        As it was in our history's dawn. \\
        Study the waymarks set by pioneers true, \\
        Their understanding of God we must review.
    }

    \stanza{
        For Satan works to change our view \\
        Of God's personality, pure and true. \\
        The Father as one God, a spiritual being, \\
        Is wisdom our pioneers were clearly seeing.
    }

    \stanza{
        Let us clear the King's highway with prayer, \\
        And for the coming shaking, prepare. \\
        Revive the old evidences, study each part, \\
        Let God's truth be written on every heart.
    }
