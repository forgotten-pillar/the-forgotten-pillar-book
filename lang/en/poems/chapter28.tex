% The prophetic call for a renewal of the old pillars

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        God calls us to the faith of old, \\
        The precious pillars are as gold. \\
        Solid foundation we reclaim, \\
        Glory to God, we all exclaim!
    }

    \stanza{
        Straight testimony must be borne, \\
        As in the Advent’s early morn, \\
        Study the waymarks which are true, \\
        Our sacred history we’ll review.
    }

    \stanza{
        For Satan works to change our view \\
        God’s personality, it is true. \\
        The trinity, it is a fraud \\
        God is our Father, one true God.
    }

    \stanza{
        Seek a revival, earnest prayer, \\
        As for the shaking, we prepare. \\
        Look for the old paths, walk therein, \\
        Plead for the Spirit to come in.
    }
