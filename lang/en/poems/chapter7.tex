% The authority of the Fundamental Principles

\begin{titledpoem}

    \stanza{
        Our principles stand firm and true, \\
        Established by God’s chosen few. \\
        A platform built on sturdy might, \\
        As guiding waymarks in the night.
    }

    \stanza{
        The truth was sought with earnest prayer, \\
        Point after point laid down with care. \\
        Yet modern minds the truth exchanged, \\
        For pleasing myths the doctrines changed.
    }

    \stanza{
        Return, O church, to truths ordained, \\
        Not to beliefs that men have claimed. \\
        Stand firm! God’s truth cannot be moved, \\
        Those Fundamental’s God approved.
    }

    \stanza{
        Let not new scholars lead astray, \\
        From paths our founders led the way. \\
        The Lord laid down these truths of old, \\
        Embrace these truths with courage bold.
    }
