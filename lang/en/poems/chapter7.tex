% The authority of the Fundamental Principles

\begin{titledpoem}

    \stanza{
        Our principles of faith stand firm and true, \\
        Established by the Lord through chosen few. \\
        A platform built on unquestionable might, \\
        Waymarks that guide us through the darkest night.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pioneers sought truth with earnest prayer, \\
        Point after point laid down with godly care. \\
        Yet modern minds have altered what was clear, \\
        Changing foundations held for many a year.
    }

    \stanza{
        Return, O church, to truths that God ordained, \\
        Not to revised beliefs that men have claimed. \\
        Stand firm upon the rock that cannot move, \\
        In Fundamental Principles approved.
    }

    \stanza{
        Let not new scholars lead your faith astray, \\
        From paths our founders walked in heaven's way. \\
        The Lord Himself laid down these truths of old, \\
        Embrace their power with faith both strong and bold.
    }
