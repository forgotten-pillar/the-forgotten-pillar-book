    \stanza{
        Beside truth’s track, the false does tread, \\
        A line so fine, we must be led. \\
        Without the Spirit’s help to guide \\
        Satan will cause the truth to hide.
    }

    \stanza{
        Two views diverge upon this script, \\
        One view symbolic roles depict. \\
        The other literal, true and real, \\
        Both views are held with ardent zeal.
    }

    \stanza{
        Father and Son, in actual hues? \\
        Or metaphors, just finding clues? \\
        Opposite paths, so close beside, \\
        Without God’s help, we can’t decide.
    }

    \stanza{
        Within the Bible, truth unfolds, \\
        Made in God’s image, we are told. \\
        Not just in symbols, but our frame, \\
        Reflecting Him, likeness the same.
    }

    \stanza{
        Fathers on earth reveal God’s ways, \\
        Our spirit too, like Him portrays. \\
        In speculation, myst’ries thrive \\
        Truth from God’s Word, it is alive.
    }

    \stanza{
        So take God’s Word just as it reads \\
        Reject men’s theories and their creeds \\
        Take what God says, no more, no less, \\
        With humble hearts, the Lord will bless.
    }
