    \stanza{
        Beside the track of truth, error does tread, \\
        A line so fine, where the Holy Spirit lead. \\
        In words familiar, God's personas blend, \\
        Father and son, where meanings extend.
    }

    \stanza{
        Two views diverge on this sacred script, \\
        One symbolic, the other clearly depicted. \\
        As mirrors of man, in His image cast, \\
        God forms our essence, from the first to the last.
    }

    \stanza{
        Father and Son, in literal hues, \\
        Or metaphors for the divine clues? \\
        Truth's narrow path, so closely lain, \\
        Beside the error, we strive to explain.
    }

    \stanza{
        For through the Bible, meanings unfold, \\
        In God's own language, bold and told. \\
        Not just in symbols, but in our frame, \\
        His likeness, His nature, forever the same.
    }

    \stanza{
        As earthly fathers reflect His ways, \\
        So too our spirit His nature portrays. \\
        In discussions of God, where mysteries thrive, \\
        Let scriptures speak, and in faith we dive.
    }

    \stanza{
        Keep to what's revealed, in the Word abide, \\
        Where human theories and errors collide. \\
        God in His fullness, a mystery remains, \\
        Yet in His Word, His truth sustains.
    }
