    \stanza{
        In faith’s first light, they sought His face, \\
        Through earnest prayer, they felt His grace. \\
        The pioneers, with vision clear, \\
        In 1840’s, held God dear.
    }

    \stanza{    
        "The judgment hour has come," they cried, \\
        To tell the world, both far and wide. \\
        The Ancient of Days, they did proclaim, \\
        Not a trinity, but a singular name.
    }

    \stanza{    
        Ellen White, with her pen in hand, \\
        Spoke of the heav’nly glorious land. \\
        A sanctuary to be cleansed, \\
        In love with Jesus, our best Friend.
    }

    \stanza{    
        First angel called us to revere, \\
        Our God the Father, we should fear. \\
        "Who is the God we should adore?" \\
        Not trinity—they did implore.
    }

    \stanza{    
        The Trinity, was unembraced, \\
        By pioneers, God’s word they traced. \\
        Father, the Ancient, they declare, \\
        His judgment right, beyond compare.
    }

    \stanza{
        Yet, whispers now, through time have spread, \\
        Trinity’s shadow, causing dread. \\
        If this was God they must declare, \\
        Their mission failed, caught in despair.
    }

    \stanza{
        But this is falsehood, error bold, \\
        A new belief, but wrongly told. \\
        The God once worshipped, with great zeal, \\
        Was the true God, their mission real.
    }

    \stanza{
        In unity, we seek His face, \\
        Embrace His truth, with fervent grace. \\
        The pio’neers’ vision, do not lose, \\
        For in their footsteps, we must choose.
    }

    \stanza{
        Worship the God, of days of old, \\
        Ancient of Days, as was foretold. \\
        Third angels’ message, clear and bright, \\
        Guiding us still, through darkest night.
    }
