\begin{titledpoem}
\stanza{
    In threefold name we're baptized true, \\
    Not trinity as some construe. \\
    The Father, Son, and Spirit's role, \\
    Not one God formed of triple whole.
}

\stanza{
    Ellen White's words make clear the case, \\
    This pledge brings heaven's divine grace. \\
    The powers three have pledged their might, \\
    To guide the faithful toward the light.
}

\stanza{
    Not proof of essence three-in-one, \\
    But heaven's promise, freely done. \\
    A covenant of help divine, \\
    As new believers cross the line.
}

\stanza{
    The Father – God, in person real, \\
    The Son – our Prince, our wounds to heal, \\
    The Spirit – Christ's representative, \\
    Through whom His presence we receive.
}
