% Ellen White and Matthew 28:19

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In threefold name we’re baptized true, \\
        Not trinity as some construe. \\
        The Father, Son, and Spirit’s role, \\
        Not one God formed of triple whole.
    }

    \stanza{
        Dear Ellen’s words make clear the case, \\
        This pledge assures us heaven’s grace. \\
        The powers three have pledged their might, \\
        To guide the faithful to the light.
    }

    \stanza{
        Not proof of essence three-in-one, \\
        But heaven’s promise, freely done. \\
        A covenant of help divine, \\
        As new believers cross the line.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Father – God, in person real, \\
        The Son – our Prince, our wounds to heal, \\
        The Spirit – representative, \\
        Through Him Christ does in us now live.
    }
