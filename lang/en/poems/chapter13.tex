% The Sabbath God vs. Sunday God - J. B. Frisbie

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        On seventh day or first we kneel, \\
        But deeper truths these days reveal. \\
        Not just when we choose to pray, \\
        But which God we serve each day.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Sabbath God, a Being clear, \\
        With form and place, both far and near. \\
        In His image we were made, \\
        His Son the perfect likeness displayed. \\
    }

    \stanza{
        The Son, the Father's image bright, \\
        Shows us the path to truth and light. \\
        "Who's seen me has seen the Father too," \\
        Christ's words both powerful and true.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Sunday God, a trinity, \\
        Three persons in strange unity. \\
        Without body, without part, \\
        A concept born from human art.
    }

    \stanza{
        One God with face and hands and form, \\
        Who rested when creation's storm \\
        Had ceased its work on seventh day, \\
        This God commands we rest and pray.
    }

    \stanza{
        Not some essence spreading wide, \\
        Formless spirit with no side. \\
        But a Person on a throne, \\
        With His Son, yet not alone.
    }

    \stanza{
        So choose not merely when to kneel, \\
        But which God your heart finds real. \\
        The day we keep reveals our view \\
        Of which God we believe is true.
    }
