% The Sabbath God vs. Sunday God - J. B. Frisbie

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        On seventh day or first we kneel, \\
        But deeper truths these days reveal. \\
        Not only when we choose to pray, \\
        We show which God we serve each day.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Sabbath God, a Being clear, \\
        With form and place, both far and near. \\
        For in His image we were made, \\
        His Son, His likeness is displayed.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Son, the Father’s image bright, \\
        Shows us the path to truth and light. \\
        "In Me you’ve seen the Father too," \\
        Christ’s words are powerful and true.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Sunday God, a trinity, \\
        Three persons in strange unity. \\
        Without a body, without part, \\
        A concept born from human art.
    }

    \stanza{
        One God with face and hands and form, \\
        Who rested when creation’s storm \\
        Had ceased its work on seventh day, \\
        This God commands we rest and pray.
    }

    \stanza{
        Not just an essence spreading wide, \\
        A formless spirit with no side. \\
        But a true Person on a throne, \\
        With His own Son, yet not alone.
    }

    \stanza{
        So choose not merely when to kneel, \\
        But choose which God your heart finds real. \\
        The day we keep reveals our view \\
        Showing which God we serve as true.
    }
