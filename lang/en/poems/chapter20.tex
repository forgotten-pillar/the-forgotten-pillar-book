% Dr. Kellogg and Ellen White writings

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In faith’s foundation, once so clear, \\
        Dear Ellen’s words, we should revere. \\
        J.H. agreed, yet in deceit, \\
        And twisted truth, in his conceit.
    }

    \stanza{
        The enemy—dear Ellen warned— \\
        Will twist beliefs, till they are scorned. \\
        These dangerous theories, wrongly dressed, \\
        In Scripture’s garb, the false impressed.
    }

    \stanza{
        "False!" she declared, against the tide, \\
        His crafty statements were denied. \\
        Defense was strong, her vision, broad \\
        The Fundamental were from God.
    }

    \stanza{    
        No word was changed, not peg nor pin, \\
        From when the pillars did begin. \\
        Now who would dare to move a board— \\
        This platform built up by the Lord.
    }

    \stanza{
        For Kellogg’s stance did not agree, \\
        Foundation was not trinity. \\
        God’s personality is true; \\
        Confusion came through Kellogg’s view.
    }

    \stanza{   
        Yet, Ellen stood, unyielding, firm, \\
        The early truth she did confirm. \\
        Against the tide of Trinity \\
        She held the truth of deity.
    }

    \stanza{    
        Today, as then, let’s hold the line, \\
        The early pioneer faith, divine. \\
        Truth’s legacy, let’s rightly claim, \\
        Unchanging, solid, still the same.
    }

    \stanza{    
        The way God led, let’s not forget, \\
        These principles are firmly set. \\
        Against the changing winds of doubt, \\
        Her writings guide, within, without.
    }
