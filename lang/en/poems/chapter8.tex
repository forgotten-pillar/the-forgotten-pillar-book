% Constructive Criticism

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        A personal God in heaven sits enthroned, \\
        This truth in our Principles firmly zoned. \\
        Present everywhere by Spirit's might, \\
        This foundation stood as our guiding light.
    }

    \stanza{
        Then came words that seemed so wise and deep, \\
        A subtle shift that made the faithful weep. \\
        "God's form beyond all human thought," they claimed, \\
        A mystery too vast to be contained or named.
    }

    \stanza{
        "Discussions of God's form," the Temple said, \\
        "Are futile paths where idols lie ahead." \\
        Yet this philosophy so smoothly spun, \\
        Was the very snare by which souls were won.
    }

    \stanza{
        The error dressed as truth appeared so fair, \\
        As scripture twisted in a clever snare. \\
        One small step from the Principles we held, \\
        One giant leap by which our faith was felled.
    }

    \stanza{
        Beware the mind that thinks itself too wise, \\
        To see deception veiled in truth's disguise. \\
        God is personal, definite, and real, \\
        This is the truth the Temple would conceal. 
    }
