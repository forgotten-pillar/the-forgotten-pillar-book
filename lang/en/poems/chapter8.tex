% Constructive Criticism

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        A person, God in heav’n, enthroned, \\
        In this our founding truths were zoned. \\
        All-Present by His Spirit’s might, \\
        These truths stood as our guiding light.
    }

    \stanza{
        False words that seemed so wise and deep, \\
        A subtle shift made faithful weep. \\
        "God’s form beyond all thought," they claimed, \\
        This mystery could not be named.
    }

    \stanza{
        "Discussions of God’s form," he said, \\
        "Are futile paths that lie ahead." \\
        Yet this deceit, so smoothly spun, \\
        Was Satan’s snare, and souls were won.
    }

    \stanza{
        The error dressed as truth so fair, \\
        And twisted in a clever snare. \\
        Just One small step from truths we held, \\
        By One giant leap our faith was felled.
    }

    \stanza{
        Beware the mind that seems too wise, \\
        To see deception in disguise. \\
        The truth is—God is personal \\
        This truth the Doctor would conceal.
    }
