% The Foundation of our Faith

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Foundation pillars, laid with care \\
        By God’s pioneers, who sought in prayer \\
        A platform firm, the Lord’s design \\
        With principles, for all of time
    }

    \stanza{
        Beware the subtle shifts that call \\
        To change what should not change at all \\
        Identity, in these we find \\
        God’s revelations to mankind.
    }

    \stanza{
        Stand fast upon this solid ground \\
        Where wisdom and God’s light abound \\
        Defend these truths with all your might \\
        For in them shines eternal light.
    }
