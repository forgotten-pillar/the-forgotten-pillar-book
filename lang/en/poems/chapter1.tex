% The Foundation of our Faith

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Pillars of truth, laid with care, \\
        By pioneers who sought in prayer. \\
        Principles firm, the Lord's design, \\
        A platform strong, for all time.
    }

    \stanza{
        Beware the subtle shifts that call, \\
        To change what should not change at all. \\
        Our identity, in these we find, \\
        God's revelations to mankind.
    }

    \stanza{
        Stand fast upon this solid ground, \\
        Where wisdom and God's light abound. \\
        Defend these truths with all your might, \\
        For in them shines eternal light.
    }
