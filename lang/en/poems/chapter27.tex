    \stanza{
        A creed established past God’s Word, \\
        The voice of conscience was not heard. \\
        Test fellowship by men’s decree, \\
        From Bible rules we now are free.
    }

    \stanza{
        Those who dissent are labeled lost, \\
        Their faith they held at terrible cost. \\
        As “heretics” they are cast out, \\
        Bringing great sorrow, there’s no doubt.
    }

    \stanza{
        God’s Word alone should be our guide, \\
        Walking with Jesus, by our side, \\
        From strong convictions, do not turn. \\
        Faithful to truth, this lesson learn.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pioneers knew this freedom well, \\
        Against men’s creeds they did rebel. \\
        Truth only dwells with conscience free, \\
        As God intends His church to be.
    }
