% Steps to Apostasy

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        A creed established beyond God's Word, \\
        The voice of conscience no longer heard. \\
        Fellowship tested by human decree, \\
        From Bible authority we slowly flee.
    }

    \stanza{
        Those who dissent labeled heretics, lost, \\
        Their faith and conviction at terrible cost. \\
        Persecution follows for standing apart, \\
        When creeds replace Scripture within the heart. \\
    }

    \stanza{
        The Bible alone should guide our belief, \\
        All other authorities bringing grief. \\
        Our conscience surrenders to God's Word divine, \\
        Not to councils of men who draw the line.
    }

    \stanza{
        The pioneers knew this freedom well, \\
        Against human creeds they chose to rebel. \\
        For truth must flourish where conscience is free, \\
        As God intended His church to be.
