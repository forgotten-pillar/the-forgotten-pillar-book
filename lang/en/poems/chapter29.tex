% Remembering His teaching in our past history

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        Our pioneers proclaimed a truth both simple and profound, \\
        Upon their words our church's faith was built on solid ground. \\
        The pillars of our faith were set by God's own guiding hand, \\
        These fundamental principles on which we ought to stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        The question "Who is God?" remains of paramount concern, \\
        To worship Him in spirit and in truth we must discern. \\
        Is He a triune mystery as some now have proclaimed, \\
        Or Father, personal and real, as scripture has maintained?
    }

    \stanza{
        The warnings from our past still echo clearly through the years, \\
        As Sister White's admonishment to all the church appears. \\
        Beware of new foundations built on speculation's sand, \\
        For only truth revealed by God can permanently stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        The waymarks which have made us what we are \\
        Must be preserved through times both near and far. \\
        Hold fast the truth with faith's unwavering grip, \\
        Let not our sure foundation ever slip.
    }
