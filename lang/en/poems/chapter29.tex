% Remembering His teaching in our past history

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The pioneers shared a truth profound \\
        Foundations built on solid ground \\
        The pillars set by God’s own hand \\
        The principles on which we stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        The question, “Who is God?” remains \\
        To worship Him, exalt His name \\
        Is He a triune mystery now? \\
        Or Father God, to Whom we bow.
    }

    \stanza{
        The warnings echo through the years \\
        The testimony still appears \\
        Beware to build on sifting sand \\
        For only truth will ever stand.
    }

    \stanza{
        Waymarks which made us what we are \\
        Must be preserved both near and far, \\
        Hold fast the truth with faith’s strong grip \\
        Don’t let our sure foundation slip.
    }
