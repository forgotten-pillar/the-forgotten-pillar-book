% The future of the Fundamental Principles

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The early voice of prophecy \\
        Foretold of dangers that might be. \\
        "The devil plots," it was declared, \\
        "To steal the truths that we once shared." \\
    }

    \stanza{
        The Principles, so strong and sure, \\
        Our God designed them to endure \\
        But now the sands shifts ‘neath our creed, \\
        Because God’s voice we did not heed.
    }

    \stanza{
        Ideas new are masked as light, \\
        Removing pillars, which were right. \\
        Rewritten books, with theories new \\
        As skeptics veil that which was true.
    }

    \stanza{
        Shall Sabbath lose its sacred glow? \\
        Shall we forget the God we owe? \\
        "Foundations crumble," so it seems, \\
        As truth is lost to prideful dreams.
    }

    \stanza{
        Look back to days, our early start, \\
        Where truths divine were etched in heart. \\
        But now the devil’s strategy \\
        Erodes the truth which used to be.
    }

    \stanza{
        Dear brethren, to the past return, \\
        For early faith, our hearts must yearn. \\
        For warnings plain, and visions sent, \\
        Designed from error to prevent.
    }

    \stanza{
        Stand firm in storm as tempests roar, \\
        Reclaim the truths worth fighting for. \\
        The voice of Ellen, stark and clear: \\
        "Reject the false, the truth hold dear.
    }

    \stanza{
        Now chose, as battle lines are drawn \\
        Make sure God’s side you’re standing on. \\
        Stay on the paths cast up of old, \\
        God’s fundamentals, firmly hold.
    }
