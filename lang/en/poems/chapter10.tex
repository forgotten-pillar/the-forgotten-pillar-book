% Is God a person? - by John N. Loughborough

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In heaven’s realm, upon His throne, \\
        God dwells in form, His Word has shown. \\
        A being real with shape and face, \\
        Beyond our sight in holy place.
    }

    \stanza{    
        God’s glory shines too bright to see, \\
        We cannot bear such majesty. \\
        Yet through His Spirit, God extends, \\
        His power and His presence sends.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Father’s form in Christ we see \\
        Reflecting Him so perfectly \\
        For Christ reveals the Father’s grace \\
        And make us long to see His face.
    }

    \stanza{
        The dust was fashioned by His hand, \\
        In His own image, as He planned. \\
        For we are made in God’s own shape, \\
        Not just in virtue, soul, or trait.
    }

    \stanza{
        A Person true with body real, \\
        Not formless mist, as some appeal. \\
        The Father dwells, unseen by eye, \\
        And waits as pure hearts draw nigh.
    }
