% Is God a person? - by John N. Loughborough

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        In heaven's realm, upon His throne, \\
        God dwells in form, not spirit alone. \\
        A tangible being with shape and face, \\
        Beyond our sight in that holy place.
    }

    \stanza{    
        His glory shines too bright to see, \\
        No mortal eyes bear such majesty. \\
        Yet through His Spirit, everywhere present, \\
        His power extends, divine and pleasant.
    }

    \stanza{
        In Christ we glimpse the Father's form, \\
        The express image, perfect and warm. \\
        For we are made in God's own shape, \\
        Not just in virtue, soul, or trait.
    }

    \stanza{
        The dust was fashioned by His hand, \\
        In His own image, as He planned. \\
        A person true with body real, \\
        Not formless mist, as some appeal.
    }

    \stanza{
        The Father bodily, yet unseen by eye, \\
        Waits for the pure in heart to draw nigh.
    }
