\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In Kellogg’s book, a subtle snare \\
        Though well-disguised through crafty care \\
        From Bible truth would lead away \\
        And cause some precious souls to stray.
    }

    \stanza{
        And though much scripture there was used \\
        The early truth became confused \\
        This error served to twist the mind \\
        But in God’s Word the truth we find.
    }

    \stanza{
        God’s personality has form \\
        To Bible truth we must conform \\
        On this the Doctor wasn’t clear \\
        But early Advent truth is dear
    }
