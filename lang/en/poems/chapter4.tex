% Revision of the Living Temple

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        In Kellogg's "Temple" lay a subtle snare, \\
        A view of God that White could not forbear. \\
        His words on God's own person went astray, \\
        Though clever phrases sought to light the way.
    }

    \stanza{
        No mere revision could this error mend, \\
        Nor Trinity adoption make amends. \\
        For God's true person stands distinct and clear, \\
        A truth foundation Adventists hold dear.
    }

    \stanza{
        The enemy had laid a careful trap, \\
        Through phrases that would God's true form unwrap. \\
        Our faith's foundation must remain secure, \\
        With doctrine straight and Biblically pure.
    }
