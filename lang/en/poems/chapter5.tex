% The Patchwork Theories

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Truth established through earnest prayer, \\
        Points of faith discovered with care. \\
        Principles tested by time and trial, \\
        Stand firm against Satan's denial.
    }

    \stanza{
        Patchwork theories seek to sway, \\
        Those from the ancient, proven way. \\
        No revisions of truth we'll accept, \\
        The faithful path must be kept.
    }

    \stanza{
        The personality of God, a sacred revelation, \\
        Not subject to human innovation. \\
        Loyal hearts stand on ground that's sure, \\
        Where foundations eternal endure.
    }
