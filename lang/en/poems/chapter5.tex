% The Patchwork Theories

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        Truth was made firm through earnest prayer \\
        Creating unity so rare \\
        Through time and trial, it was proved \\
        This platform firm should not be moved.
    }

    \stanza{
        But Patchwork theories seek to sway, \\
        Us from the ancient, proven way. \\
        But no revisions weâ€™ll accept, \\
        The firm foundation must be kept.
    }

    \stanza{
        God is a person, He revealed \\
        The points of faith the Lord has sealed \\
        The visions showed this truth is sure, \\
        Forever will this truth endure.
    }
