% Dr. Kellogg and pantheism

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        In nature’s vast, a truth untold, \\
        He said God was in every fold. \\
        The trees, the breeze, the soil, the sea, \\
        God’s presence there, for all to see.
    }

    \stanza{
        Yet, in this truth where we concur, \\
        A deeper error did occur. \\
        The Trinity, unsacred bond, \\
        As pantheism and beyond.
    }

    \stanza{
        God’s personality is clear, \\
        Beyond those frontiers, we revere. \\
        For God, who’s more than nature’s face, \\
        Is personal, in sacred space.
    }

    \stanza{
        The doctor’s path did lead astray, \\
        On trinity, we cannot sway. \\
        His view of God, misunderstood, \\
        A misstep from the path of good.
    }

    \stanza{
        In nature, power does reside, \\
        It’s not God’s body that presides. \\
        Beside Him, Christ stands as our guide, \\
        And by His Spirit, life abides.
    }

    \stanza{
        In nature’s charm, God’s hand we see, \\
        Beyond the vastness, He must be. \\
        A precious God, with love so wide, \\
        In whom, in peace, we can confide.  
    }
