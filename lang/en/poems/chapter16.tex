% Dr. Kellogg and pantheism

\begin{titledpoem}
    \stanza{
        In nature's vast, a truth untold, \\
        Kellogg found God's touch in every fold. \\
        The trees, the breeze, the soil, the sea, \\
        God's presence there, for all to see.
    }

    \stanza{
        Yet, in this truth where we concur, \\
        A deeper error did occur. \\
        The Trinity, unsacred bond, \\
        As pantheism and beyond.
    }

    \stanza{
        God's personality is clear, \\
        Beyond nature's frontiers, we revere. \\
        For God, more than nature's face, \\
        Holds a personal, sacred space.
    }

    \stanza{
        Kellogg's path, though earnest, led astray, \\
        His views on Trinity, we cannot sway. \\
        The personality of God, misunderstood, \\
        A misstep from the path of good.
    }

    \stanza{
        In nature, God's power does resides, \\
        But in His Temple, He bodily presides. \\
        Besides Him, Christ stands as our guide, \\
        By His Spirit, every life does abide.
    }

    \stanza{
        In nature's beauty, God's hand we see, \\
        Yet, beyond the creation, He must be. \\
        A personal God, with love so wide, \\
        In whom, in peace, we can confide.  
    }
