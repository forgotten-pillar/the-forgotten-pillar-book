% The Fundamental Prinicples

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        A strong foundation God has laid \\
        Without a doubt it cannot fade \\
        Through earnest prayer and study deep \\
        The truths revealed we now must keep
    }

    \stanza{
        There is one God, He’s personal \\
        With form, but also spiritual \\
        His Spirit present everywhere \\
        God is all-knowing, all-aware.
    }

    \stanza{
        Our Father, the Eternal One \\
        By Christ His dear begotten Son \\
        Created all that does exist. \\
        These precious truths let’s not resist
    }

    \stanza{
        When men step off the platform firm \\
        And strange new teachings they would learn \\
        Then doctrines false with truth combine \\
        God’s principles they undermine
    }

    \stanza{
        Hold firm the truth with faithful grip \\
        Let not these anchors ever slip \\
        For what God wrought through pioneer’s hands \\
        Through time and tempest ever stands.
    }
