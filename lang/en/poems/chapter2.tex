% The Fundamental Prinicples

\begin{titledpoem}
    
    \stanza{
        The Masterworker built a foundation strong, \\
        To guide God's people as they journey long. \\
        These truths revealed through prayer and earnest toil, \\
        Stand firm on heaven's unquestionable soil.
    }

    \stanza{
        God as one personal and spiritual being, \\
        Present through His Spirit, all-knowing, all-seeing. \\
        Christ as the Son of the Eternal Father, \\
        These pillars of faith we should hold, not bother.
    }

    \stanza{
        When men depart from these principles true, \\
        Undermining foundations through teachings new, \\
        The wisdom of ages they quickly discard, \\
        And God's revealed pathway becomes sadly marred.
    }

    \stanza{
        Hold firmly the truth with unwavering grip, \\
        Let not from these anchors your faith ever slip. \\
        For what God established through pioneers' hands, \\
        Through tempest and storm eternally stands.
    }
