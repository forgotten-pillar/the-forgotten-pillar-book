I've examined the text and found no grammar mistakes that need correction. The text is well-written and follows proper grammar rules throughout. The LaTeX formatting is consistent and appropriate, and the content flows logically with proper sentence structure, punctuation, and word usage.

The text discusses theological concepts related to the Trinity doctrine in Adventist thought, comparing writings of Ellen White and William Boardman, but from a grammatical perspective, it doesn't contain errors that require correction.
