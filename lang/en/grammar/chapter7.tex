I've examined the text and found a few grammar issues to fix:

```
# Added missing article ‘the’
In the 10th chapter of the Special Testimonies, we read how God established the foundation of our faith. Sister White used several different expressions for the foundation of our faith. Her references included: “\textit{a platform of eternal truth}, \textit{“pillars of our faith”}, \textit{“principles of truth”}, \textit{“principal points”}, \textit{“waymarks”}, and “\textit{foundation principles}—all of these refer to the \emcap{Fundamental Principles}.
->
