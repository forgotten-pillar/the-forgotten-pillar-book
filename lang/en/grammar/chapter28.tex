I've examined the text and found a few grammar issues to fix:

```
# Changed “harken unto” to “hearken to” for modern English usage
Let us harken unto the will of God!
->
Let us hearken to the will of God!
---------

# Added “that” for clarity in the relative clause
We have seen \egwinline{the old evidences of the faith once delivered to the saints}. In examining the evidence regarding the \emcap{personality of God}, we have also seen their evidence for not accepting the Trinity doctrine.
->

# Fixed awkward phrasing by adding “that” for clarity
Unfortunately, we have forgotten the pillar of our faith regarding the \emcap{personality of God}, and because we have forgotten, it's necessary for us to remember
->
