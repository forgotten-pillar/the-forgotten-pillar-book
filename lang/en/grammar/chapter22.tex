# Corrected spelling of "characterising" to American English "characterizing"
[By studying our current Trinitarian belief and the works of our pioneers regarding the \emcap{personality of God}, we have found one characterising principle that distinguishes the truth on the \emcap{personality of God}, as held by our pioneers, from our current Trinitarian belief.]
->

# Added "a" before "clear line"
[In the following, we are talking about understanding and interpreting Scripture concerning God's person. Understanding God's person can be presented in two distinct, mutually exclusive understandings, which clearly draws the line between the two opposing camps.]
