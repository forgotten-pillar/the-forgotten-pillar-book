I've examined the text and found no grammar mistakes that need correction. The text is grammatically correct, including the LaTeX formatting and quotations. All sentences are properly structured with appropriate punctuation, subject-verb agreement, and word usage.

The text discusses J.B. Frisbie's comparison between the “Sabbath God” and the “Sunday God” in early Adventist theology, contrasting the concept of God as a personal spiritual being with the trinitarian concept. The formatting, including LaTeX directives, quotations, and citations, is consistent throughout.
