I've examined the text and found no grammar issues that need correction. The text is well-formatted with proper LaTeX directives and maintains grammatical correctness throughout.

The text discusses James White's pamphlet “The Personality of God” and contains numerous quotations with proper formatting. All sentences are grammatically sound, with appropriate subject-verb agreement, proper use of articles, and correct punctuation.

The LaTeX formatting (such as \textbf{}, \underline{}, \emcap{}, etc.) is used consistently and correctly throughout the document, and I've preserved all of these elements as instructed.
