I've reviewed the text and found no significant grammar issues that need correction. The text is well-written with proper grammar throughout. The document contains extensive quotations from historical Adventist sources, and these appear to be presented accurately with their original formatting preserved.

The text maintains consistent tense, proper punctuation, and appropriate sentence structure throughout. The LaTeX formatting directives are used correctly and should be preserved as instructed.

Since there are no grammar errors to fix, I have no corrections to list.
