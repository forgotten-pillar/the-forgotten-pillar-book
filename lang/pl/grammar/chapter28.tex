I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is well-written with proper Polish grammar throughout. The LaTeX formatting is correctly maintained, and the content flows naturally in Polish.

The text discusses theological concepts related to “Fundamentalne Zasady” (Fundamental Principles) and contains many quotations from religious writings, all of which are grammatically correct in Polish.
