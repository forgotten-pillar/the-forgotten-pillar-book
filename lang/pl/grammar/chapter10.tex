I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is grammatically correct and properly formatted in LaTeX. All sentences are well-structured and follow Polish grammar rules.

The text discusses theological concepts about God's personhood from the perspective of John N. Loughborough, with extensive quotations from his writings and biblical references. The formatting with LaTeX commands (like \emcap{}, \textbf{}, \underline{}, etc.) is consistent throughout the document.
