The text appears to be grammatically correct in Polish. I don't see any grammar mistakes that need to be fixed. The text maintains proper Polish grammar throughout, with correct verb conjugations, noun cases, and sentence structures.

The text discusses theological concepts related to the Trinity doctrine and the Kellogg crisis from an Adventist perspective, using quotes from Ellen G. White and other sources, but from a grammatical standpoint, it is properly written in Polish.
