I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is well-written and follows Polish grammar rules correctly. The LaTeX formatting is properly maintained throughout the document.

The text discusses theological concepts related to the personality of God, comparing views from Adventist Fundamental Principles with those expressed in Dr. Kellogg's book “The Living Temple.” It includes extensive quotations and theological arguments about God's personality and presence.

While the text contains complex theological terminology and concepts, from a grammatical perspective, it is correct and doesn't require any fixes.
