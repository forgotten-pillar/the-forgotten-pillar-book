I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is well-written and grammatically correct. The LaTeX formatting is properly maintained throughout the document.

The text discusses the foundation of Seventh-day Adventist faith, focusing on the understanding of God's personality and the concept of Trinity versus the belief in one God (the Father). It contains many quotations from Ellen White's writings, particularly her letter to Dr. Kellogg, warning against changing the fundamental principles of their faith.

All sentences are grammatically correct, with proper Polish syntax, verb conjugations, and case usage. The LaTeX formatting elements like \emcap{}, \textbf{}, \underline{}, etc. are used consistently and correctly.
