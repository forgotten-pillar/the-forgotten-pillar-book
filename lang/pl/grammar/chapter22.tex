I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is well-written and grammatically correct. The formatting with LaTeX commands is properly maintained throughout the document.

The text discusses theological concepts related to the understanding of God's personality in Seventh-day Adventist beliefs, comparing historical “Fundamental Principles” with current “Fundamental Beliefs,” particularly regarding the Trinity doctrine. It presents arguments about how to interpret biblical terms like “father,” “son,” and “spirit” - whether literally or metaphorically.

All Polish grammar, syntax, and punctuation appear to be correct throughout the document.
