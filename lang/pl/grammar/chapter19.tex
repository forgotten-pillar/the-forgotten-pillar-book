I've examined the Polish text and found no grammar mistakes. The text is well-written and grammatically correct. The LaTeX formatting is properly maintained throughout the document.

The text discusses Ellen White's interpretation of Matthew 28:19 in relation to the Trinity doctrine, explaining her view on the relationship between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. All sentences are grammatically sound and follow Polish language rules correctly.
